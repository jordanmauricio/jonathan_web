Well you got the bulk of the information in the email which I hope you read.
Anyways to open up the website open up the "Home" html which should bring you to the front page.
In pages I have the other pages. In Styles I have all css files. In tekst is just the pieces of information 
that needed to show up there.
And pictures are just the pictures I was using.

Also im not done with the homepage since its still farely bare and on the Contact page I still need to add
a picture so make sure thats possible for me to do and other edits of course if needed.

Thanks bro, Jonathan <3
